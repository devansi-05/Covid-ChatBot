# Covid-ChatBot
This is the project done by team "NULL:Error" for Hackcbs 3.0 

# Introduction:
As we know the major problem in the world right now is Coronavirus also known as Covid-19. And many frontline workers are doing their best to control the situation. 
There are so many new technologies coming up to make our lives easier during this pandemic, and the most common one are chatbots. 

# AIM:
So our team came up with the idea to create a chatbot which will help people to diagnose what type of illness they possibly have and to not get confused between the symptoms of Covid and any other illness which have the same symptoms as Covid-19. 
As most of us didn't have much knowlege in web application development so we created a simple prototype for the chatbot. Inside the code we covered the symptoms for Covid-19 and Common cold but we have a plan to expand it further to more general diseases like Diabetes, Heat diseases, Dengue and Malaria as the symptoms for these diseases are pretty similar to Covid so we don't want people to think they have Covid instead of Common cold.

# Technology Used:
 We used Relp.it IDE to make our ChatBot.
 
 
 
 
 
 We hope you all like our idea.
 Thank you.
